Build a model that can learn and predict the music that you like (Python and Jupyter): 

Steps: 

1. Import the data 

2. Clean the data (no duplicates)  

3.) Split the data into training/Test Sets

4.) Create the model (select the algorithm) 

5.) Train the model (feed it the data) 

6.) Make predictions (model makes the prediction) 

7.) Evalate and improve the model 


Popular libraries: 

Numpy: Provides a multi-dimensional array 

Pandas: data analysis library

MatPlotLib: Creating graphs on plots 

Use Jupyter as an editor 


Importing a Dataset (Jupyter): 

- Download dataset of Kaggle (generally a csv) 
- Save it in the same location as Jupyter project 
- Use pandas to display the data library 

For Ex: 
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('vgsales.csv')
df

Describing the Dataset: Shows all the basic stats of the data 
df.describe()


Displaying the values: Displays the values of the data as a 2D Array 
df.values()


Actual Project: When a user signs up we ask for their age and gender and based on their profile we suggest music that they'll like (Genre/Artists) 

The Data:

age: The user's age 

gender: 1 = male, 0 = female 

genre:  genre of their preferred genre of music 

Model/Agent: 

Using Decision Tree: Using built-in sklearn.tree 

Example Import: 

sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier 
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, Y) [
model.predict([21, 0], [22, 0])





Assumptions: 

Men between 20-25 like Hip/Hop
Men between 26-30  like  Jazz
Men 31+ are into classical 

Women 20-25 like like Dance 
Women 26-30 like Acoustic 
Women 30+ like classical
